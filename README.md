# MediTransfer

MediTransfer is a tool for generating and exporting patient data in the GDT 3.5 format. It converts form data into a structured .gdt file that can be easily imported into medical software systems such as Tomedo. This streamlines data transfer, ensuring that patient information is efficiently handled and integrated with medical practice management systems.

- Secure Data Handling: Captures sensitive patient information and saves it as structured data in a .gdt file.
